<p>2:15 – Break into small groups to test out our “Quick Customer Stories” worksheet. Wil O'Shea.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For coming meetings, we’d like to feature 2-3 local users talking for 5-10 minutes about how they use Tableau. To this end, we’ve devised a worksheet of questions to help users structure their talks. During this time, we’ll ask you to test it out and see if it sparks interesting conversations.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2:45 – Re-gather and recap which questions led to interesting conversations</p>
